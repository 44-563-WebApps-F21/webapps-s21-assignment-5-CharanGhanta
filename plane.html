<p>A fixed-wing aircraft propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine, propeller, or rocket engine is known as an airplane or aeroplane (informally plane). There are many different sizes, forms, and wing arrangements for airplanes. Recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research are just a few of the many purposes for airplanes. Commercial aviation moves more than four billion passengers on airliners each yearand more than 200 billion tonne-kilometersÂ of freight each year, accounting for less than 1% of global cargo transit. Most planes are piloted by a pilot on board, but some are designed to be operated remotely or by a computer.</p>
